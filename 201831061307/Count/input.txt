Heart beats fast.Colors and promises.How to be brave.How can I love when I'm afraid to fall.But watching you 
standalone.All of my doubt.Suddenly goes away somehow.One step closer.I have died everyday waiting for you.Darling,
 don't be afraid.I have loved you for a thousand years.I‘ll love you for a thousand more.Time stands still.Beauty in all 
she is.I will be brave.I will not let anything take away.What's standing in front of me.Every breath.Every hour has come to





 this.One step closer.I have died everyday waiting for you。
